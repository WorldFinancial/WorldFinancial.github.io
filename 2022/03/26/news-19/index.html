<p>On the morning of March 25, Dan Bin, chairman of Shenzhen East Harbor Investment, responded to the “suspected short position” report released by brokerage China in the early morning through his personal microblog, saying that the report was written in a more objective manner. He said, in fact, every major decision is not easy, have to pay a considerable “mind”, also have to bear the corresponding consequences and the end.</p>
<span id="more"></span>


<p>For Dan Bin’s “empty position”, many private equity told brokerage China reporter, on the one hand, its products to escape the recent market crash, to avoid the pain of passive position reduction due to product retraction is too large, to customers is a responsible attitude; but on the other hand, from the perspective of medium and long-term earnings, is currently the bottom area, short position risk than high position.</p>
<p>Some investors also said that Dan Bin had liquidated his position and the bull market was not far away. in the second half of 2018, Dan Bin had sold stocks such as Maotai and shorted his position for nearly six months, which seemed to be the historical bottom, and fortunately he bought it back later.</p>
<p>This week, the stock market continues to shake at a low level, a number of private equity products may hit the warning line and liquidation line, and investment pressure increases. Private placement row net data shows that as of March 25, the cumulative net value of securities private placement products below 0.85 a total of 5,842, the cumulative net value of less than 0.8 yuan of 4,162 products, the cumulative net value of less than 0.75 yuan of 2,949 products.</p>
<p>A group of investment gurus such as Warren Buffett and Musk have said that the most important thing in investing is to survive. The value investors, represented by Duan Yongping, are firmly committed to Warren Buffett’s “three no’s”, i.e. no shorting, no borrowing, and no understanding.</p>
<p>However, although the current investment is very difficult, when most investors and institutions are unable to carry, the market is often not far from the bottom. A private equity bigwig said, the past two decades to observe the A-share market, found to make big money are those who encounter difficulties can firmly believe, remain optimistic and diligent, adhere to the long-term capital of high-quality growth enterprises.</p>
<p>But Bin responds to “short position” report: every major decision is not easy</p>
<p>In the early hours of this morning, brokerage China released a report entitled “What’s going on? Private equity magnate Dan Bin is suspected of having a short position, with hundreds of products showing almost zero net worth fluctuation! A number of large private equity firms sounded bullish”. The reporter observed that hundreds of products under private equity bigwig Dan Bin are suspected to be running short or light.</p>
<p>The company’s products have been updated 3 times since March, but almost all of them have a net value fluctuation close to 0. Other private equity products that have updated their net value have been affected by the market crash in March, and all of them have seen significant retreats. The brokerage China reporter speculated accordingly, possibly as early as the end of February, but Bin has already significantly reduced his position.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 25, Shenzhen Oriental Harbor Investment Chairman Dan Bin responded to the “suspected empty position” report through his personal microblog, saying the report was written in a more objective manner. In fact, every major decision is not easy and requires a considerable amount of “heart and soul”, as well as the consequences and endings. “From February 2021 to February 2022, a whole year of our A-share and Hong Kong stock investment did very badly, I often blame myself and often reflect and think - investment philosophy intertwined with changes in the social environment how to make investment trade-offs.”</p>
<p>Subsequently, but Bin further said that the position is relatively low, probably in the 10% or so.</p>
<p>On March 23, at the 18th anniversary of the establishment of Orient Harbor, Dan Bin disclosed the scale of the company’s capital for the first time, saying that the current management scale of Orient Harbor is close to 30 billion.</p>
<p>If calculated by 10%, that is, but Bin’s current position market value of about 3 billion, hands still have 27 billion yuan of bullets, the next when to increase positions will also be of great concern to the market.</p>
<p>For Dan Bin’s “empty position”, many private equity told brokerage China reporter, on the one hand, its products to escape the recent market crash, to avoid the pain of passive position reduction due to product retracement too large, to customers is a responsible attitude; but on the other hand, from the perspective of medium and long-term earnings, is currently the bottom area, short position risk than a high position.</p>
<p>“Timing increases the difficulty of investment, but if not fully timing, customers can not stand, do private equity to help others manage money is really difficult.” Shenzhen a private equity responsible person said, but Bin so low position, the original batch of long-term value investment faithful may be difficult to accept.</p>
<p>Tens of billions of private equity big brother apologized, a number of private equity products or will touch the warning line</p>
<p>This week, the stock market continues to shake at low levels. 25 March, the Shanghai Stock Exchange index fell 1.12%, hovering above 3200 points; the CSI 300 index fell 1.81%, while the GEM index fell heavily by 2.52%.</p>
<p>With the continued market downturn, a number of private equity products may hit the warning line and liquidation line. The data on the private placement network shows that as of March 25, there were 5,842 securities private placement products with a cumulative net value below 0.85, 4,162 securities private placement products with a cumulative net value below 0.8 yuan, and 2,949 securities private placement products with a cumulative net value below 0.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The company’s main goal is to provide a comprehensive range of products and services to the public.</p>
<p>“Touch the early warning line of the product, because they do not dare to easily increase positions, fearing that a mistake in increasing positions will be liquidated, so need to survive for a period of time.” The head of a private equity in the south said.</p>
<p>This week, 10 billion private equity institution Shiva Asset released a “letter to investors”, which also attracted much market attention. Its head, Liang Hong, apologized to all investors for the poor performance over the past year, the temporary losses caused to everyone, and the mistakes he had made in various aspects.</p>
<p>In last week’s weekly product report, Liang Hong said that due to six funds and FOF products with lower NAV involving the warning line and another fund nearing the liquidation line, he was forced to reduce some of his positions on Monday to meet the risk control requirements, resulting in these products breaking even or gaining less in the last week.</p>
<p>In a volatile market environment, private equity products are inevitably subject to large net worth fluctuations. Although the current market is tough, when most investors and institutions can not carry, the market is often not far from the bottom.</p>
<p>A number of bigwigs have spoken out: has fallen to historical lows, no need to be pessimistic</p>
<p>A private equity big brother said, the past two decades to observe the A-share market, found that making big money are those who encounter difficulties can firmly believe, remain optimistic and diligent, adhere to the quality of growth enterprises of the long term capital.</p>
<p>Many positive signals are also emerging. On the one hand, many public and private equity to come up with the money white silver self-purchase to follow its products; on the other hand, there have been a number of star private equity voice, firm market bottom confidence.</p>
<p>According to private placement row net incomplete data statistics, since this year there have been nearly 50 public fund companies launched self-purchase, the actual self-purchase amount of more than 2 billion yuan; more than 11 private equity managers announced self-purchase, the cumulative / proposed self-purchase amount of more than 1.265 billion yuan, of which there are 9 tens of billions of private equity.</p>
<p>Zou Yi, general manager of RedChip Investment, pointed out at the communication meeting that from the perspective of equity risk premium (ERP), the current A-share has fallen to a relatively low level in history, and there is no need to panic in this position strategically. The impact of negative factors may gradually decline in the future, the country’s “stable growth” is expected to drive the economy in the second quarter, from the valuation and earnings growth, A shares in the world still has a strong attractiveness. This year, we should be patient enough with the market, stay optimistic in the midst of panic and adjust our positions.</p>
<p>Dong Chengfei, who has just joined Rui Xian Assets, said at a small channel internal exchange event: “Market quality companies have fallen back to a more reasonable valuation range after the retreat. Therefore, there is no need to be too pessimistic about the market this year, the long period ahead belongs to the transition period and low return period, now is the stage to choose future opportunities, if chosen well, after patiently waiting, we will eventually reap some rewards.”</p>
<p>On March 24, trillion public fund Guangfa fund vice president, top flow fund fund big brother Liu Gesuo said: “to cherish this position of A-share assets, this kind of volatility in history also, but not everyone can grasp. After each round of sharp declines, quality stocks offer more attractive buying opportunities and investment returns than ever before. Therefore, there is no need to remain pessimistic during the bottoming out phase of the market after a deep pullback. What we should be thinking about now is what assets have been ‘misplaced’.”</p>
