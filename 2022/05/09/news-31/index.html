<p>A few years ago, getting a job in Google, Meta and other big Silicon Valley companies was like standing on the top of the career pyramid. In the eyes of outsiders, multi-gold, decent and highly knowledgeable …… Many haloes in one.</p>
<p>However, things are starting to change now. While Silicon Valley is still a hot commodity, there is another field of work that is becoming even more exciting - Web 3.</p>
<span id="more"></span>


<p>In the Web 2 era, Google, Meta and other Silicon Valley majors were the shining stars. But when they became giants, they firmly controlled the flow of information with their centralized model. Users had almost no privacy to speak of and suffered greatly.</p>
<p>The blockchain, cryptocurrency and non-homogenized tokens in Web 3 decentralize the flow of information and resources and give users autonomy. More and more people believe that Web 3 represents the next direction of the Internet.</p>
<p>As Web 3 takes on Web 2, the wave has already begun to invade the job market, leaving employees of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies raring to go.</p>
<p>A report by Business Insider shows that prominent executives and developers are leaving established companies for crypto, blockchain and other decentralized projects.</p>
<p>The once big Silicon Valley Web 2 is fading from its former glory. And what is it about the new darling, Web 3, that is attracting employees?</p>
<p>For those interested in the Web3 space, you can add Silicon Rabbit WeChat: usted9 (note Web3) and enter the Silicon Rabbit Race web3 exchange group for more learning and discussion.</p>
<p>Jumping from Web 2 to Web 3 companies<br>From Web 2 to Web 3 companies, this staff migration boom starts with executives.</p>
<p>In January, Ryan Wyatt, head of YouTube games, left to join Polygon Studios.</p>
<p>Polygon is a decentralized ethereum scaling platform, and Polygon Studios is its games and NFT division. the Polygon Studios ecosystem is home to many popular games and NFT projects.</p>
<p>Also in January, Sherice Torres, the former chief marketing officer of Meta’s digital wallet project, jumped to the same role at blockchain payments company Circle.</p>
<p>Sandy Carter, vice president of cloud computing at Amazon , has also left her old home to join crypto company Unstoppable Domains.</p>
<p>When she posted the Unstoppable Domains job link on LinkedIn, 350 people clicked on the link to apply for interviews within two days. She exclaimed, “The momentum we’re seeing in this space is unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Google VP Surojit Chatterjee, on the other hand, left the company in 2020 to become the chief product officer of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.</p>
<p>At Google, concerns about retaining employees to keep them from drifting to crypto companies have begun to grow, according to sources. It’s a topic that has become a weekly discussion between CEO Sundar Pichai and his deputies.</p>
<p>In addition, executives from other Silicon Valley majors are defecting to Web 3. Lyft’s former CFO and Uber’s former director of corporate development have joined OpenSea, the NFT exchange, and Chris Lehane, Airbnb’s former senior vice president of policy and communications, has joined a crypto venture capital fund.</p>
<p>Many Web 3 companies have been able to attract many big-time employees even with their small size.</p>
<p>For example, 80% of the 20-person team at blockchain technology company Mysten Labs is made up of employees from big players like Meta, Google, and Netflix. It is worth mentioning that the four founders of Mysten Labs are all from Meta, so the whole company has a “big factory pedigree”.</p>
<p>Coinbase, of course, has almost tripled its headcount to 3,730 in a year.</p>
<p>Coinbase says it will hire more than 2,000 more people this year for its product, engineering and design teams to pursue growth opportunities in Web 3 and other areas.</p>
<p>Coinbase has its own set of requirements for job applicants, such as giving preference to employees with qualities such as clear communication, efficient execution and continuous learning. In addition, they should be able to work in a “mission-centric” manner.</p>
<p>In general, the number of employees associated with Web 3 is skyrocketing, in addition to executives, and Electric Capital reports that developers of GitHub repositories associated with blockchain projects have increased by 100% since last year.</p>
<p>Web 3 is really outpacing Web 2 in terms of employee appeal.</p>
<p>Reasons to flock to Web 3: Prospects, higher pay<br>There is an old Chinese saying: “A good bird chooses a tree to live in.</p>
<p>When people come out to work, no matter which field they choose, the most important thing is the development prospect and salary compensation.</p>
<p>In these two aspects, Web 3 companies have obvious advantages over Web 2 companies.</p>
<p>First of all, the younger generation nowadays likes to work in more cutting-edge and cooler fields. Especially for technology practitioners, they are problem solvers who look forward to learning new and emerging things and don’t want to fall behind the curve.</p>
<p>Right now, Web 3 is still an emerging field, with new technologies and models emerging, and employees have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>Alex Bouaziz, CEO of payroll software company Deel, for one, says, “People want to work on the most exciting and innovative areas of technology, and right now that’s encryption and Web 3.”</p>
<p>Moreover, Web 3 carries a mission to build and shape the future of the entire Internet, which adds more professional honor to employees.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of industry prospects, Web 3 also reveals a broader scope than Web 2.</p>
<p>Web 2 has been developed for twenty years and has entered a bottleneck period of slowing development, with serious inward rolls and recent layoffs in major factories. Web 3, on the other hand, as the direction of the next-generation Internet, is in the midst of rapid growth and still has great potential.</p>
<p>Data shows that the daily active addresses of the Ethernet chain have increased from 200,000 in January 2020 to 550,000 recently. This means that more and more people are participating in the Web 3 economy.</p>
<p>Also, according to Footprint Analytics, the total global crypto market cap has doubled in the past year and is now over $2 trillion. More and more money, is flowing into the decentralized space.</p>
<p>Data source: Footprint Analytics</p>
<p>What is particularly important to note is that compared to Web 2, Web 3 is no longer a single technology, but a field integrated by a number of technologies such as digital currency, blockchain, and metaverse, which has a larger market capacity than Web 2 and more space for employees to play.</p>
<p>Every tech worker dreams of changing the world with code.</p>
<p>However, while generating power for love and pursuing dreams, it is also important to consider the bread in your hands.</p>
<p>According to Levels.fyi, senior software engineers at all five FAANG companies (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) earn more than $300,000 per year.</p>
<p>It seems to be already higher than many traditional industries, but Web 3 out of the gate is even more generous.</p>
<p>According to the social forum Blind, Coinbase pays software engineers up to $900,000 a year.</p>
<p>Chatterjee left Google to join Coinbase in February 2020, and when Coinbase went public in April 2021, Chatterjee’s stake soared to more than $600 million, just 14 months after he joined, so don’t suck up too fast.</p>
<p>Some of the smaller Web 3 companies than Coinbase have been equally generous. Blockchain finance company Silo Finance, for example, offers senior engineers a salary of $300,000 to $750,000.</p>
<p>Peter Levels, founder of Nomad List, tweeted, “Like it or not, Web 3 is easily offering two to five times the salary of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>And Web 3 can provide employees with lucrative salaries, behind there is also because of the surge in investment, more food and grass.</p>
<p>Blockchain startups raised a record $25 billion in venture capital last year, more than eight times the previous year, according to CB Insight.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/05/09/KuBk3RdIbZ2P5xl.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Data source: CB Insight</p>
<p>Compared to Web 2, Web 3’s compensation structure has another huge attraction - tokenization.</p>
<p>At some Web 3 companies, the incentive offered to executives and employees is tokens rather than equity.</p>
<p>Compared to equity, tokenization has higher liquidity, and instead of waiting for the company to be acquired or IPOed before discounting, employees can convert tokens to cash at any time and receive benefits in advance.</p>
<p>Rethink yourself and follow the times<br>Some Web 2 majors spit out that Web 3 companies have robbed their own employees.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this kind of trolling is powerless. Behind the migration of employees, two problems are mapped out: something is wrong with itself; the times have really changed.</p>
<p>In January this year, Glassdoor, the largest recruitment and review website in the United States, released the “2022 Best Employers List” in the country. Many of the once top-ranked Silicon Valley majors are in serious decline.</p>
<p>For example, Meta, which has been on the list for 12 consecutive years, fell from 11th place last year to 47th place this year, a direct drop of 36 places. This is the lowest ranking in its history.</p>
<p>Many Meta employees have publicly complained about their company’s “toxic corporate culture” during the epidemic, with serious overtime work.</p>
<p>In addition, Zoom’s ranking also dropped significantly this year, from 22nd place last year to 100th place this year. Some employees said that the high business and fast-paced work environment has led to a negative shift in corporate culture.</p>
<p>Overtime is serious, but the company has not seen an improvement in the situation, which is the most employees at a loss. In the past six months, the stock price of many technology companies in Silicon Valley is getting worse.</p>
<p>Meta’s share price has fallen from a high of $380 last year to $184 now, a 52% drop. Even if the name was changed to Meta to enter the meta-universe, it didn’t help much to raise the share price.</p>
<p>The big Silicon Valley companies complain about their employees flowing to Web 3 companies, in fact, they still have to find the reason from themselves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Web 3 companies attract employees, which is driven by the times.</p>
<p>Looking back, from the end of the 20th century, the rise of Web 1, and then Web 2 rolled in, the rise of each wave is accompanied by a wave of employee migration. The same is true for the rise of Web 3 this time.</p>
<p>The times are pushing employees to newer, more valuable businesses.</p>
<p>Instead of complaining, Web 2 companies should follow the times and start by changing themselves.</p>
<p>Circle, like the one Sherice Torres left Meta to join, is not a young company, it was founded in 1997. It’s just that it’s updating its business with the times and is currently helping companies use stable coins and public blockchains for operations like payments.</p>
<p>In February of this year, Google also said it was looking into how to take Web3 and blockchain networks and apply them to its own business. </p>
<p>There are generations of talented people coming up, each leading the way for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Give you a ticket to board Web 3, will you go with them?</p>
