<p>I don’t know if you remember the quote.</p>
<p>“We wanted flying cars, but instead we got 140 characters.”</p>
<p>We used to think that Iron Man’s plans to go to Earth and Mars were truly exciting revolutions, representing the most exciting direction of the future. Twitter was its antonym.</p>
<p>It would not have occurred to anyone at the time that the first thing Musk did after returning to the Internet was to privatize Twitter. In explaining the acquisition to the Twitter board, he said that Twitter was “a global platform for free speech” but that it could not fulfill this “social responsibility” in its current form and “needed to become a private company. “</p>
<p>On the evening of Musk’s acquisition deal, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey also sent out a very interesting tweet, saying, “Twitter should not be owned or operated by anyone, it should be an agreed-upon public good, not a company. To solve this problem, Musk is the only solution I trust.”</p>
<p>Will Musk follow the path preset by Jack Dorsey or become the next king of the centralized monopoly social network?</p>
<p>What kind of mission has Jack Dorsey given himself, and what kind of new land is Bluesky that he is fully committed to?</p>
<p>Can Twitter, the chirping bird and its inhabitants of this digital kingdom, transcend existing boundaries by agreement and build a new world?</p>
<p>We invited Suji Yan, founder of Mask Network, to share his thoughts on these questions from the perspective of an insider observer, and half a month later, not only is the podcast not out of date, but there are more points to be made.</p>
<p>The following are the selected interviews</p>
<p>One: An insider’s view of Jack. Dorsey: unconventional and bent on getting rid of Twitter<br>Silicon Valley 101: There’s nothing interesting going on in the old Internet world these days, but the Web 3 world is moving very fast, and Facebook and Twitter have both made some Web 3-related transformation plans. Now there’s another figure like Musk who has a series of ideas for transforming Twitter, and it should be interesting to talk to Suji about that today.</p>
<p>Suji Yan: I was one of the first to join Bluesky, and I can’t say I’m a founding member, they don’t have a founding member concept. They just started a website and a discord group with a bunch of open source and blockchain people, Jack Dorsey and Jay Graber, who later became the CEO of Bluesky, were also in it.</p>
<p>After some time, I can understand why if I were a traditional investor, I would also think Jack Dorsey is not a good CEO, and I would be annoyed with him and hate to fire him. But if I were a Generation Z person, a user who still has ideals for the Internet, I would still appreciate Jack Dorsey as the founder of Twitter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Musk has been away from the so-called Internet for some time, working on cars, working on rockets, and then suddenly he’s back, and he’s not just back, he’s involved, he’s had some public shouting matches with Jack Dorsey very early on. So we weren’t that surprised when we saw that Musk was going to privatize Twitter, I was more surprised by the speed at which things were going. I also have a lot of personal experience and insight to share in this chat today.</p>
<p>Silicon 101: You said that in the Bluesky community, you can probably understand why Jack Dorsey is not a good CEO, why?</p>
<p>Suji Yan: People think that a good CEO of a technology company, like Tim Cook, is very good, has a high salary, wakes up at 5am and runs, goes to the front line of a factory in China, and has a professional managerial spirit. But Jack Dorsey is not, he is not interested he disappeared.</p>
<p>For example, you know that Jack Dorsey created an NFT with his first tweet, and behind this was a project called Cent, which we invested in, and they wanted to turn every tweet into an NFT and asked me if I could find Jack. I said it might be difficult, from a normal company’s point of view, people are the executive CEO of a company, what you want to do is in conflict with their business, why support you?</p>
<p>But I still helped him to introduce, Jack is not difficult to find, but he does not return your message, or he disappeared, after two days after the appointment and disappeared, ask is to do yoga. Later he appeared again, normally you want to see Ma Huateng or see Zhang Xiaolong Zhang Yiming to talk about something, there must be some process in the middle, to go through some people. But Jack Dorsey showed up this time and just said yes, no process, he probably decided in a second and sold his tweets directly.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley 101: There’s so much unpredictability with Jack Dorsey. It was around 2020 when hedge fund Elliott Management tried to kick him off the board, and it was Silver Lake Capital that negotiated with Elliott for $1 billion to keep Jack Dorsey on Twitter. To be fair, Jack Dorsey’s share price has not performed well during his time at the helm.</p>
<p>Suji Yan: Elliott’s attempt to kill him is also related to Bluesky. Jack Dorsey’s sins go beyond meditationand coin speculation. As CEO of two publicly traded companies, he tweeted every day without talking about his two companies at all, and he probably looked like a full-time Web 3 investor or evangelist to others. He has since changed his Twitter profile and deleted it all, with one phrase: “Bitcoin”.</p>
<p>He said “Don’t mention Twitter to me” in everything he said at Bluesky, and shareholders would have been devastated to hear it. He also promised to push Twitter to get money for Bluesky. later you can see that Bluesky is doing things very slowly, and there is much less activity, mainly because the funding did not come down, Jack’s control and voice were weakened because Elliott came in, and did not get a lot of money from Twitter to bring into Bluesky.</p>
<p>II: The Protocolization of Social Media: Grassroots Bluesky and the Magnificent Facebook Libra<br>Silicon Valley 101: A brief introduction to Bluesky, which, if I understand correctly, wants to be a protocol for decentralized social networking. Twitter is a company, Bluesky it could be an independent organization.</p>
<p>Suji Yan: Bluesky was founded at the end of 2019. Because Twitter’s logo is a blue bird, Jack thought the bird was going to fly into the blue sky.</p>
<p>He also did a lot of things that were very symbolic, such as creating a Twitter account for Bluesky, and the first tweet he sent was the letters “lo”, which is a very geeky stunt because the first message in the history of the Internet in 1969 was “lo “The operator tried to type “log in”, but the Internet went down after the second letter.</p>
<p>Rather than making it a commercial company, Jack Dorsey made it a PBLLC, a trade association or NGO, and Bluesky may have felt like a bunch of rabble-rousers at the beginning, either in a bad sense or in a very strange way. For example, Bluesky did not have a CEO position, there was only a manager or community leader, a girl named Jay Graber, who is also a friend of mine, and her workplace experience is not traditional, she came out of Zcash, also an anonymous coin.</p>
<p>At the same time, Facebook started Libra, which is a high-flying organization with professional managers from Visa and Uber. The second time I met with Jay was at a meeting at Stanford, and I was quite happy to go there, intending to learn a little, but when I went in, I didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley 101: Facebook paid for the sponsorship.</p>
<p>Suji Yan: Yes, the style of action was completely different; Facebook had to find the best professional managers, go to the best schools, go to Stanford to get sponsorship, and contract the whole building to hold the conference. In contrast, at that time Bluesky felt like a guerrilla group, a group of people wearing flip-flops and T-shirts playing games and speculating on coins in the discord group, talking about some very strange things every day, very funny, and not getting any sponsorship because there was no budget at all.</p>
<p>Silicon 101: It’s also interesting how these two things ended up, Facebook just disbanded Libra a while ago, Bluesky is still around, but it’s not making much progress and is being criticized by the industry, and as I said earlier, it may have run into some obstacles from the Twitter board. I’m curious why Jack Dorsey came up with the idea of Bluesky when he already had Twitter, what was his own philosophy?</p>
<p>Suji Yan: The original idea of Twitter was decentralized, and the four founders started with the idea of being a podcast incubator, which was based on RSS, which was the first generation without a centralized distribution technology, so the exchange between Twitter and the decentralized technology of that era was very deep. Many of the big innovations, such as hashtag, such as drop-down refresh, are not this company, and this community took the lead, and third-party clients used to be a good direction to start a business.</p>
<p>Until Jack Dorsey was killed for the first time, there were several management changes and a lot of tightening, we saw the third-party clients all shut down, and also did a lot of completely closed source, no longer open things.</p>
<p>At this point, we can only say that the founders themselves still have the idea of decentralization, the company has no relationship with these, you can no longer see what communication between Twitter and the community, from what ideas, only to see it copy Clubhouse to do Twitter Space, this is all public history. Jack as a young entrepreneur to make shareholders happy, to be forced to do these things. Twitter, a company with a market cap of $30-40 billion, made $300 million in annual profits last year, which is actually very bad.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley 101: I purposely made a comparison, today Facebook’s market cap is $57 billion, Twitter’s market cap is $34.4 billion, a 16 times difference. Why has Twitter’s market cap been in the doldrums when it’s also a social media company?</p>
<p>Suji Yan: This kind of organization requires centralized power, and its source is the company’s governance financial reportto look good, which is the opposite of the so-called democratic, open and free Internet. Copying or open robbery is very straightforward. The model of the company is Facebook, think about the acquisition of Instagram, those two founders do not listen to me to kill.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley 101: I’ve heard another version of this story. Jack Dorsey was also trying to buy Instagram, and he reportedly offered a higher price than Zuckerberg. Jack knew the founder of Ins, and when Ins was in its early days, Jack was constantly posting ins on Ins to support it. When Jack heard that Ins had accepted Facebook’s offer, he was so angry that he shut down his account.</p>
<p>Suji Yan: Ins’ choice of Facebook may not really be a matter of money. If I were a young CEO I look at the Twitter gang doing yoga every day, the Facebook gang are awesome, a lot of secret technology and advanced algorithms, so more people can use my product great great, I may also be sold at a lower price.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I’m 96 years old, younger than many entrepreneurs, and I think they rarely think about the social aspect: when you have a very efficient machine and a very ruthless algorithm, it can bring efficient growth, but after a certain inflection point, it acts as a social network distributor, both as a referee and as an athlete, and what it brings is the destruction of traditional values. destruction, which is the two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Three: Influence Jack. Dorsey’s values: to agreement, not platform<br>Suji Yan: From the perspective of the company, Twitter may be a loser, but if we look at it from the perspective of the protocol, Facebook is not much of a bull, it and Twitter, Today’s headlines, Tencent, and Ali are all losers. The Bitcoin Foundation and the Ether Foundation are just a few people with a very short history. People may think that Bitcoin is more of an asset, but Ether has a lot of developers in it, and it’s more decentralized than Twitter ever was, and Ether came out in 2015 and now has a market cap of $300 billion, and it’s really figured out that it wants to be a protocol, not a platform.</p>
<p>I think Jack Dorsey and his old group of shareholders were caught in the middle of that transition of an era that was very painful. What he wanted in his heart was a protocol that would last forever, break through the boundaries of business and non-business, and break through the boundaries of nation states, but he was forced to create a company and make a platform in that era, and then the criteria for examining the platform and the company was the profit model.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley 101: Did Musk see this coming? Did Musk want a deal, or a platform?</p>
<p>Suji Yan: Musk has been away from the Internet for a while, his last Internet company was Paypal, and he was surrounded by only two people, Jack Dorsey and Cathie Wood, and the three of them saved a meeting called “B world”. After the meeting, I saw him buying coins and interacting with the community afterwards, which was quite amusing. I’m sure he shares a strong ideal with Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Silicon 101: There was a theory that Musk bought it to help Jack Dorsey return to Twitter, what do you think?</p>
<p>Suji Yan: First of all, if there are no surprises, Jack Dorsey will resign naked and leave Twitter’s board next. I believe Musk’s purchase of Twitter at this point in time must have something to do with Jack’s resignation and support him at this time. As for whether they have communication with each other, I don’t know.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley 101: Where did the news of Jack’s naked resignation come from?</p>
<p>Suji Yan: Jack said it himself. When he announced his resignation last year, he tweeted an open letter saying he would remain on the board for the duration of his term, and then leave ever</p>
