<p>The artist Beeple may not have thought that his “ordinary” work would have such a big impact. Although he is known as a “visual artist” for his persistent daily work for 13 years and his convincing surrealist painting style, he has recently shocked the art world again with his NFT (Non-Homogeneous Token).</p>
<p>The NFT digital painting was created using a combination of 5,000 smaller images and sold at Christie’s for more than $69 million by Beeple’s hand, signaling a new era in digital collectibles based on the blockchain crypto asset NFT.</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of the metaverse, digital currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum in the blockchain have gradually become known, and people continue to explore, imagine and create that mysterious unknown world.</p>
<p>In the field of sports, digital still becomes the goal of its continuous development and pursuit. Once upon a time, sports collection was one of the fields in which the public participated, and collectibles such as “fallen field version” jerseys, the same shoes of the players, and stickers of the players became the proof of “love” of sports fans, and also They are always reminding themselves to keep their originality.</p>
<p>With the development of the digital sector, digital sports collectibles have gradually taken over the market and become an area where clubs and stars are competing to take advantage of the boom and reap the benefits, but perhaps not as much as they would like.</p>
<p>After all, it seems that a significant portion of the population is not convinced of this virtual space.</p>
<p>Liverpool and AC Milan have entered the NFT<br>According to Deloitte’s forecast, sports-related NFT transactions will exceed $2 billion in 2022, a figure that will be double that of 2021, the year of the “NFT”. And as previously reported, the English Premier League is about to invest in NFTs, which could see 20 clubs launch official digital assets worth hundreds of millions of pounds within the year.</p>
<p>Some time ago, Premier League giants Liverpool launched their first digital collection, which features 23 players in the team as heroes and is available in “hero tokens”, limited to 171,072 tokens at $75 each, meaning Liverpool is hoping to reap about $12.83 million (about £9.83 million) from it. What is the concept?</p>
<p>Liverpool is the most self-sustaining team in the EPL. In the two years when the EPL was most affected by the epidemic, Liverpool lost less than £50 million, far less than the other “Big 6” teams (Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea). According to its financial report last season, Liverpool only lost 9.53 million pounds, if we do not talk about whether Liverpool will donate half of the NFT income to the Liverpool Charitable Foundation, the income alone can even fill last season’s losses.</p>
<p>In an earlier auction, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and the players’ independent NFTs were sought after, with the team’s star, “Egyptian Pharaoh” Salah, selling for $88,200, while Klopp and right-back Arnold, who has 19 assists this season, both fetched high prices.</p>
<p>Similarly, Serie A giants AC Milan also released a limited edition 3D NFT of the club’s special Milan shirt, selling for 45 euros, a total of 75,817 pieces, the same as Liverpool, the proceeds will also be donated to the Milan Foundation.</p>
<p>In addition to the clubs have entered the game, the stars are not willing to lag behind. British soccer star David Beckham became a global brand ambassador for the open source blockchain DigitalBits in March this year, based on which the handsome and charming Beckham will launch a series of digital assets such as NFT.</p>
<p>The blockchain platform has also had a partnership with Inter Milan, another Serie A powerhouse, to integrate and accept XDB cryptocurrency for payments in the stadium, Inter’s online and physical stores, as well as create digital player cards and NFT digital collectibles through the use of the DigitalBits blockchain.</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar has even become a big fan of NFT, spending 159.99 ETH (Ether) on the NFT codenamed “Bored Ape Yacht Club #6633” in order to update his Twitter avatar. there are also reports that Neymar will invest in the NFT field.</p>
<p>Although NFT in China is not as hot as abroad, it still has a group of collectors of digital collectibles.</p>
<p>During the Beijing Winter Olympics, which just ended some time ago, the ice dun dun became a Netflix hit, and even “a dun hard to find” situation, while the ice dun dun products in the digital field are still hot, providing an example for NFT + sports. The “ice dun official digital blind box NFT” was snapped up as soon as it was put on sale, and the price was even speculated to more than a thousand times.</p>
<p>On nWayPlay, though, only 500 were put on sale, with a limit of five per person and a unit price of $99. A series of pins for the Nordic United Beijing 2022 mascot, Bing Dun Dun, was offered at a low of $2,000 and a high of $88,888.</p>
<p>What is the value of NFT?<br>For a long time in the 20th century, sports card collecting was very popular, but with the increasing supply of cards, the gradual fragmentation of card manufacturers, and the development of the Internet, sports cards are gradually falling into oblivion.</p>
<p>In fifa online series of games, if you want to build a competitive team, you must have the best star card, but the probability of such a card being drawn in the card pack is very small, so many people will invest large sums of money into the game, just to be able to increase the probability of being drawn, and some people spend thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars to buy a game account with a retired legendary star card, which is similar to NFT There are similarities and differences with NFT.</p>
<p>Currently, the market for sports NFT is mainly focused on three directions: sports games, collectibles and fan economy. So, what is its value? Perhaps those loyal fans of NFT will ask themselves such questions, and Internet+Sports summarizes the following points.</p>
<ol>
<li>Collecting value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compared to real-world sports collectibles, digital collectibles make it easier for sports fans to get access to them, and many companies that have developed NFT business have their own trading platforms where fans can collect exciting moments, digital autographs, or digital tickets for major sporting events. The NFT is a unique and unique collection.</p>
<p>Most NFTs are unique and highly collectible. Even if it is the same picture, the code behind it is not reproducible, unique, and each limited release will increase the scarcity of NFT.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Commercialization value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just like some people will buy and sell game skins to obtain benefits, NFT naturally also exists “buy and sell” market, through the hype, the commercial value of NFT will only be more flourishing, and if you buy a NFT, it will be printed on T-shirts for sale, or the development of games are viable commercial channels, will also bring a lot of value .</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Increase the association with clubs and stars.</li>
</ol>
<p>This interaction with the fans will bring the team closer to the fans and help them to take the next step in the industry. Sports NFTs give sports fans a new way to experience the game, learn more about the players by purchasing NFTs related to them, and even help fans feel engaged in any situation and allow players to interact with fans in a more memorable way.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>“ID” for sports fans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fans may verify their fan identity through NFT, for example, if you have all the NFT of the Toronto Raptors in Top Shot (NBA Top Shot is the most popular platform for users and sales created by Dapper Labs, creators of the famous NFT project CryptoKitties), perhaps the team will give you a home ticket! Some teams will give away some team swag in return for your support.</p>
<p>Lastly is the aforementioned opening up new sources of revenue for clubs, especially at a time when epidemics are normalized.</p>
<p>But just like buying game skins, although they do have collectible or ornamental value, they are not enough to spend sky-high prices for collecting, which is itself a kind of impulse spending, and after being sensible and sober, how many people can pay for the sky-high price of sports NFT?</p>
<p>And NFT itself also reveals many problems.</p>
<p>The proper “IQ tax”?<br>The aforementioned Liverpool NFT has been questioned by many fans, believing that Liverpool’s move is to enrich themselves (obviously it is not easy to use the enthusiasm of the fans to guide consumption, even in the UK, a country with a deep fan culture), and NFT has also been pointed out that there is no environmental protection, pure speculation and other negative news, even though this time Liverpool has explained that this NFT trading mechanism is more environmentally friendly than the general virtual currency 99.95%.</p>
<p>Therefore, Liverpool wants to collect part of the funds hope declared defeated, in a week or so, as much as 95% of the NFT was not sold, and only sold about 9,700, only accounting for less than 6% of the issue, enough to see that NFT is not everyone into the game can earn a lot of money.</p>
<p>For the average person, the high price may also be one of the factors that dissuade them from buying NFT.</p>
<p>There is also an objective issue of environmental protection. cryptoKitties crypto cat is a blockchain game that allows users to buy, breed, sell and collect virtual cats with different patterns, colors and looks, and naturally there is a difference in value, which is similar to a virtual pet.</p>
<p>However, according to a study by NFT Club, an NFT education company, the CryptoKitties crypto cats require about 4 million trees to offset the carbon emissions, mainly because of the varying levels of CO2 produced by the websites they are attached to.</p>
<p>And according to the NFT Club, the entire process of NFT from casting, bidding, to the final transaction and transfer of funds will produce the corresponding CO2, “the average NFT will produce 211 kg of CO2 over its lifetime”, which seems to be a considerable challenge for the environment.</p>
<p>There is also news that domestic NFTs are more environmentally friendly than overseas. At the end of last year, “Blockchain Technology Activates Digital Cultural Heritage” was released, which elaborated on the fact that Chinese digital collections consume less than 1% of the energy of overseas NFTs, which is truly low-carbon and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>At present, NFT influx into the domestic for only a year, the technology seems to have been relatively mature, but the industry chaos regulation is still unsound, which also led to many NFT speculators of a lot of money to the waste.</p>
<p>It is understood that the domestic NFT digital collectibles trading platform, such as Tencent’s phantom core, Ali’s whale probe, etc. are not open to secondary market transactions, only the transfer function. Therefore, a large number of NFT transactions can only be carried out in the gray area, group chat, second-hand trading platform has become its carrier.</p>
<p>In many NFT trading groups, the group owner will release some “common money, common wealth” words, and the group members are convinced of this, because the lack of industry authority endorsement, the quality of the content is not the same, resulting in speculators to buy at high prices but can not circulate, can not sell the NFT is a photo. In addition, the group owner crazy to raise the price, resulting in many speculators bought at high prices after the blood money.</p>
<p>In the period of barbaric growth, whether domestic or foreign, the NFT market is like a pavilion in the air, perhaps only until the day the mechanism is sound, the industry standardized, the public can see some NFT from that virtual space, the real shadow.</p>
