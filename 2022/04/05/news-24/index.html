<p>The first web pages were created at CERN over 30 years ago, imagined by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and other scientists.</p>
<p>Their vision at the time: that the web should be an open standard system for all to use, Web 2.0 transitioned the internet from sharing information to the age of social media, allowing users to create, share and collaborate without the need for web design or technical skills.</p>
<p>Take a look back at the iterations of the web so far. In Web 3.0, it’s all about expensive business services and e-commerce, where only the strong survive. As in the analogue era, information still flows from one to many.</p>
<p>In the Web 2.0 era, it became easy and inexpensive to create services on the Web, and social networks began to take off. Blogs were the first iteration of Web 2.0, and Twitter was the first and latest social network to come out.</p>
<p>Web 3.0 isn’t going anywhere, it’s the future</p>
<p>But now the online world is no longer a series of files on a server viewed through a PC. It’s a series of devices and objects. For us, the “online” economy includes the brown Amazon package that falls on the doormat from time to time, the iPod ……. but rather the CD collection that has been stored there for a lifetime, the Kindle, and so on.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of research into the future of what Web 3.0 will be. One view is that Web 3.0 is a device-driven version, rather than a PC/browser-driven version of Web 2.0 - one in which the ability to put up commercial fences around information eventually becomes socially acceptable to users because they can no longer get what they want for free and need to pay to get it.</p>
<p>A more radical vision of Web 3.0 is Tim Berners Lee’s idea of the ‘semantic web’, where computers can derive so much meaning from existing information that they can begin to interact with each other on behalf of humans. This would be a seamless network of information that is both socially constructed and mechanically categorised.</p>
<p>This is, of course, described as Metaverse 1.0 - a world in which information and human life begin to interact seamlessly through devices. James Cameron’s film Avatar captures this vision.</p>
<p>Approach<br>When considering ICT in a changing society, we must of course also ask - from what perspective?</p>
<p>Web 3.0, a network no longer confined to browsers or even to screens - is a network in a multi-device, multi-channel and multi-directional information throughput world involving sensors and many other devices we have never seen before. The change this represents is huge.</p>
<p>The Google of Web 3.0, you will have to pay</p>
<p>Web 3.0 is a network where ICT is clearly around us, our information, our needs and information in real time: some people are starting to call it a “streaming” network. We would like to certify thinking about this latest trend, Web 3.0, and make a suggestion about what it might mean, and what might be needed to understand its perspective.</p>
<p>The Internet field - often described as Big Data - defines Web 3.0 as “semantic Web technologies that integrate into or enhance large-scale Web applications”.</p>
<p>This is very different from the definition of the Internet of Things, which we believe is a more accurate description of Web 3.0. Many others have echoed this broad technological focus in their understanding of the phenomenology. As with Web 2.0, most papers addressing the phenomenon rarely use any real theoretical perspective to approach it, other than using social network theory.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the (smaller) second category, Fuchs et al. focus on the socio-political consequences, referring to Web 3.0 as a collaborative network - arguably not too different from the description of Web 2.0 as a read-write network. For many of these and other authors, Web 2.0 is widely regarded as a ‘cultural construct profoundly influenced by the rhetoric of commerce’, much the same as Web 3.0 would be.</p>
<p>In the third (and even smaller) category, some seem to agree with the definition of ‘a new online environment’ that will integrate user-generated data to create new meaning. In contrast to Web 2.0, which was understood to be based on user participation, Web 3.0 will be based on user collaboration.</p>
<p>The FAANG bigwigs had to adopt some Web 3 technologies</p>
<p>But they still criticise “concepts such as Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 as viable and successful theoretical models for social analysis”, when in fact they are themselves “cultural constructs”.</p>
<p>There is, of course, another group of people who see the concept of Web 3.0 as a useful category of distinction, in the same way that a distinction is made between a primarily agricultural and industrial economy, although nowadays it is always a mixture of the two, and in the case of the Web the difference is more social than technological.</p>
<p>Such cultural structures, despite their historical and theoretical contingency - and regional specificity - are ultimately our only windows, and to ignore them is to dismiss all theory.</p>
<p>An ‘understanding of Web development’ that tends towards a linear progression to co-existing social and technological trends is problematic. The political economy and neoliberal discourse of new Web applications cannot be wished away, the logic of capitalism in the Internet age is indeed fast-paced and accompanied by a huge population.</p>
<p>Culture, context and business - the trinity of brand growth revisited in the age of Web 3.0</p>
<p>Yes, the concepts of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 often carry the assumption of user practices: Web 2.0 is seen as enabling user engagement, while Web 3.0 is seen as triggering user collaboration.</p>
<p>Technological innovations and systems relate to use and how what we have is involved and integrated into our daily activities.</p>
<p>The #uksnow event<br>To many, Web 3.0 is much more complex than envisaged in many articles to date. Take the #uksnow event a few years ago as an example.</p>
<p>Opinion leader Paul Clark mused on his blog throughout the cold morning, envisioning the “#uksnow” application in terms of the natural phenomenon of snow in the UK and, as such, what would happen to crowdsourced data. A few hours later, keen programmer and opinion watcher Ben Marsh created the code needed for a Twitter-GoogleMaps mash-up, and #uksnow was available to the blogosphere.</p>
<p>The syndication site for commenting on blogs and highlighting ‘trending’ topics on Twitter found the mashup and, like the blogosphere, the popularity fuelled growth.</p>
<p>Following the instructions on Ben Marsh’s website, thousands of people used the microblogging site Twitter to tweet two simple messages: the first three to four digits of the UK postcode of their current location and a rough measure of the heaviness of the snow at their location as a fifth marker, for example “BL7 2/5 “.</p>
<p>The #uksnow map app, where content on this app can be shared on Twitter with the hashtag</p>
<p>People have provided this information to #uksnow by “tagging” them on Twitter (for example, they tweeted “#uksnow BL7 2/5”). These tweets, which are posted nationally, create what is known as a Twitter stream. Such streams can be captured using simple search tools and can be displayed by web applications or used for other purposes.</p>
<p>The stream #uksnow hashtag from a remote collection provided the data to place one of the five different sized snowflake images on GoogleMap in the UK and thus on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.benmarsh.co.uk/snow/%E5%88%9B%E5%BB%BA%E4%BA%86%E8%8B%B1%E5%9B%BD%E7%9A%84%E5%AE%9E%E6%97%B6%E9%9B%AA%E5%9C%B0%E5%9C%B0%E5%9B%BE">http://www.benmarsh.co.uk/snow/创建了英国的实时雪地地图</a>.</p>
<p>It was clear that people were standing outside taking pictures of snow because they were following the trend and using their mobile internet devices to provide the desired tweets. This can easily be deduced from the popularity of Twitpic photos with short URLs accompanying the location and snowfall data in the tweets.</p>
<p>By the end of the first day, Microsoft had created a clone of the program. The app survived for a few more days as the snowfall continued, but within the first 36 hours the app gained a large number of tweets and user visits.</p>
<p>Random photo of snow falling, Twitter tweet ‘Snowing Newbury ❄❄❄❄❄️ 5/10 #uksnow’</p>
<p>At the time, the baseball World Series was taking place in the US at the same time, but was briefly overshadowed in terms of Twitter traffic by the number of people tweeting about (and #uksnow).</p>
<p>This #uksnow event is a good example of what we would describe here as Web 3.0.</p>
<p>Borrowing and extending Orlikowski’s concept of scaffolding, the physical infrastructure is easily identifiable as the mobile internet, including the mobile devices themselves that support it, the signalling poles that broadcast and receive signals within each cell, and the cluster of servers that host and route the millions of digital files involved.</p>
<p>The technology scaffolds with a snow cloud meteorological scaffold across the British Isles, with precipitation varying according to atmospheric conditions and topographic elevation. The combination is a cultural phenomenon of social networking, as well as microblogging technology using a minimal truncated (140 characters) version of the (160 characters) short message service standard, a salt-scarce political situation, a disaster-obsessed media and an age-old British obsession with the weather.</p>
<p>The resulting ‘mash-up’, in the narrow sense as a web-based application and in the broader sense as a specific event in a different context, represents a situation that benefits from an understanding of Orlikowski’s scaffolding social material.</p>
<p>Stills from Netflix’s ‘Social Dilemma’</p>
<p>Attempts to understand and explain this phenomenon from a technocentric or purely human-centric perspective miss such interconnected aspects of modern life.</p>
<p>Moreover, the scaffolding that makes #uksnow possible demonstrates how emerging cultural and social practices come together, not only for the weather, but also for the new possibilities inherent in mobile internet technology scaffolding and the potential of microblogging.</p>
<p>Once the snow melts, the show is over, forgotten and discarded. It also represents the extremely flexible set of potential implications of the technologies involved and the cultural obsessions they directly cater to.</p>
<p>Post-structuralist thought<br>In the past, before the advent of the World Wide Web, computing systems were small, discrete, short and controllable.</p>
<p>Since the advent of ICT, with the advent of Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and now Web 3.0, it is important to ask: Is our notion of ‘system’ broad enough?</p>
<p>The central philosophical implication of this re-imagining of systems, implied by the insight of complexity, is that the security, clear integrity and boundaries of systems, as we have envisaged them in the past, are beginning to disappear.</p>
<p>Web 3.0 promises a decentralised and more interconnected web space</p>
<p>Extending our understanding of systems beyond the simple computational information systems commonly discussed in some literature, one of the central insights of 20th century structuralist thought is that in the 19th century and before, we were centred on those things.</p>
<p>In fact, the broad concept of ‘system’ is not central, but is determined by the system itself</p>
<p>Post-structuralist thought in the 1960s and beyond has further revealed that such structures are often not even ‘systemic’ in themselves: in a socio-historical context, open systems are self-organising and self-determining, and so constantly changing that any definition of a system becomes redundant as soon as it is proposed.</p>
<p>Of course, the most basic, traditional definition of a system, with which most IT specialists are familiar, is that it consists of an integrated whole with boundaries, internal and external. An information system can equally be defined as an integrated system of hardware and software used by individuals and organisations to create, collect and process data.</p>
<p>However, as interpretivist researchers would immediately suggest, information systems are not only used by people and organisations, but the system may be thought to include those people and organisations, in complex interrelationships of change and constraint, so the very notion of the system as an integrated whole with internal, external and boundaries is being challenged by these new complex understandings.</p>
<p>Cryptopanties art/fashion works are created with the aim of bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds</p>
<p>We see Web 3.0 as both a model for these pragmatically complex systems and a paradigm for the philosophical shifts required to understand them.</p>
<p>For example, in order to understand - as the first class of commentators (as articulated by Hendler) the nature of much of what happens in Web 3.0, as a traditional ‘information system’, for example, is like using soil science - although useful and accurate for the study of the soil itself - trying to understand agriculture as a whole.</p>
<p>This approach is to ignore all the rich additional material, such as the different types and grades of seeds, the attention of animals and birds, the changes in the weather and the different machines put into use to manage the soil.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this approach does not even begin to take into account the whole historical, cultural, regional and transnational complexity of the use of these machines by human farming communities and agricultural economies, procurement and cultivation.</p>
<p>So, just as the soil scientist must work with the seed scientist, the irrigation technician with the agricultural equipment manufacturer and finally the farmer, the farmer must work with the seed wholesaler and the vagaries of his/her product market, so the IT specialist must understand that what is conceived as a ‘system’ in the IT specialist is in fact much more complex. In fact, it is much more complex and contingent.</p>
<p>The Flying Fish Club: “the world’s first member-only private dining club where membership is purchased as an NFT on the blockchain”</p>
<p>Theoretical tools must be developed to see information and communication technologies (ICT) not only as open but, in short, as complex systems and open not only in the sense of incorporating a range of human and other factors other than information technology itself, but in the sense of duration.</p>
<p>In short, much of what happens in what is classified as Web 3.0 is emergent, as used by complexity theorists such as Kaufman, for whom a complex whole can expel collective properties, i.e. is itself a legitimate ‘emergent’ feature.</p>
<p>So the road to Web 3.0 is not a smooth and bright one. Starting with the concept of distributed ledgers, blockchain technology is taking the left foot for mankind to embark on the Web 3.0 planet, while the optimists say five years, the pioneers have gone longer, before the realisation of a better digital future.</p>
